          <h2>Hi, I'm Gwen Stacy</h2>
          <p>
Im a 25 year old spider woman, I stand at 5'9" with an athletic build, reflecting the physical demands of my dual life as both a biochemist and a superhero. My blonde hair and blue eyes are often noticed, but it's my determination, agility, and strength that truly define me. Whether I’m in the lab or swinging through the city, I maintain a confident, focused demeanor, and my superhero persona only enhances my resilience and adaptability.
          </p>
          <p>I am a passionate biochemist, scientist, and superhero with a deep commitment to both protecting my city and advancing the field of science. With a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry from Empire State University, I have developed a strong understanding of molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioengineering, which has allowed me to combine my scientific knowledge with my unique abilities.</p>
          <p>After gaining spider-like powers from a lab accident, I developed enhanced agility, reflexes, and strength, along with the ability to stick to walls and a heightened sense of danger, often referred to as "spider-sense." These abilities have not only made me an exceptional scientist but also a protector of my community. Whether leaping between buildings or facing life-threatening situations, my scientific expertise and superhuman abilities allow me to approach challenges from multiple angles.</p>
