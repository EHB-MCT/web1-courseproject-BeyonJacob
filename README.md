I wanted something related to a Marvel superhero. Then I found my favorite character—Gwen Stacy, also known as Spider-Woman. She is amazing and cool.

On the first page of the website, when you open it, there is, of course, a logo and navigation menu in the header. I animated the navigation menu with a hover effect when the mouse is placed over each page.

The second section features the big, bold name "Gwen Stacy," a short description, and a call-to-action button with a hover effect. I also animated a PNG of Gwen sliding in from the top right corner of the screen. I achieved this using ChatGPT; here’s the link to the conversation: https://chatgpt.com/share/67689c6f-451c-8001-97ec-ba435f08d802

The third section includes "Experiences and Reviews." I added five images with accompanying text and implemented a scrolling animation inspired by this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/0TnO1GzKWPc?si=hJ8Jymn_wZrj01MI

On the "Skills" page, I showcased skills in a similar style to the homepage, using five images with animations. I used ChatGPT to create the animations; here’s the link to the chat: https://chatgpt.com/share/67689e0c-378c-8001-abab-6973a7dca31e

On the "About" page, I added a single image with a hover effect and a short bio. I kept the animation very simple, using a fade-in effect from below.

I didt do the hamburger menu because i did't had time.
